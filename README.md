Welcome to **Chorus Stage**, the core backend network powering the Chorus social project. This API-first service is the heart that connects everything ‚Äî managing user identities, communities, posts, votes, and moderation, all with a strong focus on user anonymity.

## About Chorus Stage

Chorus Stage is the backend API for the Chorus Network. It exposes a clean, open set of API endpoints that empower clients and users to:

- Create, join, and leave communities  
- Post new content and reply with comments  
- Register new users and update user profiles securely  
- Cast votes, participate in the democratic moderation process  
- Handle community moderation openly and transparently  

‚Ä¶and much more as development progresses.

The network is built to be secure, with all communications encrypted end-to-end and sensitive data stored securely. However, Chorus is fundamentally designed to provide **anonymity** rather than traditional notions of privacy or security. Users are identified solely by unique, cryptographic public keys (ed25519) that are exclusive to the Chorus network. Each client generates a new key-pair locally during account creation to ensure keys are not reused elsewhere, preventing cross-platform fingerprinting and preserving user anonymity. No emails, passwords, or personal information are required or stored. Privacy is achieved through this strong anonymity model ‚Äî no personal data is linked or retained.

## The Bigger Picture

Chorus Stage is one essential component of the larger Chorus ecosystem, which includes:

- **Chorus Voice**: The upcoming official client app for iOS, Android, and web platforms  
- **Chorus Audience**: A simple, read-only web viewer acting as the public landing page and content gateway  

Together, these modules aim to build a genuine alternative social platform grounded in true anonymity, community control, and open development.

## Security

Security and cryptography details are summarized in `SECURITY.md`, including
the server threat model, primitives in use, PoW construction, and our audit
roadmap. End-to-end encryption for messaging happens on clients; the server
stores opaque ciphertext and optional protocol headers.

## Core Principles Behind Chorus Stage

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Anonymity First**: Users are identified only by unique, network-exclusive cryptographic keys generated locally on clients, never by personal data or reused accounts.  
- üîí **Security by Encryption**: Communications are encrypted end-to-end, and all sensitive information is securely stored.  
- üó≥Ô∏è **Decentralized Democracy**: Community moderation is transparent and governed by users‚Äîno secret rules or moderators.  
- üìñ **Open API**: Every feature is accessible and documented, encouraging openness and extensibility.  
- ‚ú® **Transparency**: Development and moderation happen in the open for full accountability.
